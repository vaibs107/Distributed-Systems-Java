#Distributed-Systems-Java
Napster and Gnutella Style P2Ps
* The distributed systems projects have two purposes: 
	- first to make you familiarize with sockets/RPCs/RMIs, processes,threads.
	- second to learn the design and internals of these peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing systems.
* Language used: Java with Remote Method Invocation (RMI)

B-Link Tree Project
* The project aims to achieve the following:
	1. Implementation of a simple B-Link tree for indexing in a Distributed file system or Object storage, using Java.
	2. In-depth comparison of different techniques used for indexing with each other and B-Link tree on parameters such as read latency, Compare and Swap (CaS) operation/write latency, prefixed listing cost, and concurrent reads/writes. 
	3. Concluding on whether B-Link tree is a good alternative for indexing, and in which cases. Complete performance analysis of it on above parameters using real world workflows.
